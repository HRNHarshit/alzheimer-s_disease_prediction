# Alzheimer's Disease Detection using Machine Learning

This project leverages machine learning models to detect Alzheimer's disease from medical images. By analyzing these images, the model can predict the likelihood of Alzheimer's, providing valuable insights for early diagnosis and patient care.

## Brief Overview

In the modern technological era, addressing health issues through advanced technology is crucial. Alzheimer's disease affects millions worldwide, and early detection can significantly improve patient outcomes. This project utilizes deep learning to analyze medical images and predict the presence of Alzheimer's disease with high accuracy.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/alzheimers-detection.git
    cd alzheimers-detection
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Upgrade pip and install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade pip
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
